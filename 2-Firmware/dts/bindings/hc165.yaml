  74HC165 chip, SPI binding

  Driver bindings for controlling a series of 74HC165
  with a SPI master.

  The SPI driver should be usable as long as a zephyr SPI API driver
  is available for your board. Hardware specific tuning is required
  using these properties:

    - spi-max-frequency
    - sck-pin : connected to the CP port of all chips
    - miso-pin : connected to the Q7 port of the last chip
    

compatible: "hc165"

include: [spi-device.yaml]

properties:

  pl-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true

    required: true
    description: gpio connected to the CE port of all chips
  
  chain-length:
    type: int
